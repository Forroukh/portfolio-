            <h3>Web developer</h3>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

        <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <h3> <span class="name-highlight"> 2020-2021 - Programming Hero</span></h3>
        <p>As the Web has grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet, developers have gotten more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>front end development (the visible parts of a website or app)</li>
           <li> back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)</li>
           <li> full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)</li> </ul>
           <p> To understand what each of the web developer specialties are, we’ve created a guide breaking them all down, along with the skills you need to learn to become a full stack developer—if that’s your thing.</p>

        <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort matters to the company.
            The only problem is that you just don’t become an integral part of a team overnight as you need to prove yourself. The only way to prove yourself is by your work, and the only way to get the work done is to learn all that you can. You will gradually realize that it is a process and being surrounded by people sharing common interests, you are most likely to find this transition easier than it initially seemed to be.</p>
